DBD::PgAsync
------------

This is a fork of DBD::Pg (3.18.0) intended to fully support
asynchronous database operations. In addition to the existing DBD::Pg
async support, this needs

	1. Support for async connect via PQconnectStart/ PQconnectPoll.
        2. Support for async prepare PQsendPrepare.
        3. Removal of synchronous database operations embedded in
           dbdimp.c functions, eg, in pg_db_cancel.

1) is implemented using a special attribute to connect and a method
named pg_continue_connect which functions as interface to
PQconnectPoll. See manpage for more details.

2) is implemented as well. The code should transparently use
PQsendPrepare instead of PQprepare for async statements.

3) completed so far:

	- pg_cancel no longer waits for the result of the cancelled
          query.

	- transactions started automatically when autocommit is off
          use asychronous command execution          

Bug reports etc specifically about this code should probably rather be
sent to me than to any other DBD::Pg address, especially including the
principal author of most of the code (<greg@turnstep.com>).
